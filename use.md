# What is HTTP/2 and Why Use It?

## 🌐 What is HTTP/2?

HTTP/2 is a newer version of the HTTP protocol used to load websites. It helps websites load faster and work more efficiently than the older version, HTTP/1.1.

---

## ✅ Why HTTP/2 is Better

### 1. Faster Connections
- Many files (like images, CSS, and JS) can be loaded at the same time using one connection.
- No need to open multiple connections like in HTTP/1.1.

### 2. Smaller Data Size
- Repeated information in headers is compressed, saving data.
- Good for APIs and dynamic websites.

### 3. Smarter Loading
- The browser can decide which file to load first (like CSS before images).
- Improves website performance.

### 4. Server Push
- The server can send files (like CSS or JS) before the browser asks.
- Makes websites load faster.

### 5. Better Communication
- Uses binary instead of text, making it faster and easier for computers to understand.

## 🔒 Secure by Default

- HTTP/2 usually works with HTTPS, which keeps data safe and encrypted.

---

## 🌍 Supported Everywhere

- Most browsers like Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge support HTTP/2.
- Web servers like Apache (2.4.17+), Nginx, and others also support it.

## 📝 Summary

HTTP/2 makes websites:
- Load faster  
- Use less data  
- Perform better on slow networks
